# Dayhoff
Micro-array based disease prediction using Deep Neural Network

## Description
Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for classification of micro-array is what this project all about. The same model after traning can also be used for disease prediction, drug desing using exceptional responder's EHR Data and much more. The name of this Project is Dayhoff as ***Margaret Dayhoff*** is cosidered the mother of mordern Bio-Informatics.
