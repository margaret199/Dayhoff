# Dayhoff
Micro-array based disease prediction using Deep Neural Network

## Description
Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for classification of micro-array is what this project all about. The same model after traning can also be used for the disease prediction, drug desing using exceptional responders data and much more. The name of the Project is Dayhoff as ***Margaret Dayhoff*** is cosidered as the mother of mordern day Bio-Informatics.
