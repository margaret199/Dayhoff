# Dayhoff
Micro-array based disease prediction using Deep Neural Network

## Description
Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for classification of micro-array is what this project all about. The same model after traning can also be used for disease prediction, drug desing using exceptional responder's EHR Data and much more. The name of this Project is Dayhoff as ***Margaret Dayhoff*** is cosidered the mother of mordern Bio-Informatics.

#Chroms detector
Micro-array based disease prediction for the detection of chromosomal disordered foetus.
By predicting the disorders by the aminotic fluid is collected and loaded in the device the result will generate in hour's
It will be more accurate than karotyping method.
Cost will be lesser and than karotyping, and the results will be more acurate.
